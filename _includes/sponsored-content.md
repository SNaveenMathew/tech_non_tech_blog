A sponsored post will be in the "Sponsored" category, you can identify it at the beginning of a post, here is an [sponsored post template](https://renanfranca.github.io/sponsored-post-template.html).

## What is the difference between a regular post and a sponsored post?
The content is created by me as always. The only difference is that the client chooses the subject which I am going to write about it.

## Why should I sponsor a post?
Please, [read my blog posts](https://renanfranca.github.io/archive-date.html) and see if you like my writing style.

Some of my blog posts [got featured](https://www.polywork.com/renanfranca/collections/1086932). It's cool, isn't it?
