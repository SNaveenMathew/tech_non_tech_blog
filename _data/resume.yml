  intro: >
    I am a software engineer since 2008 (<a href="https://www.polywork.com/renanfranca">check out my professional and personal timeline</a>). Disciplined and Organized java software engineer. I am always ready to help my team to succeed, with a smile on my face üòÅ. Every time I struggled with a particular problem, I document how I overcome it and share it with my co-workers. So no one will spend time when faced with the documented problem.
    I decided to build that blog to share some of the problems I overcome and I will share what I learn from them.
