I'm moving my blog out of [Medium.com](https://snaveenmathew.medium.com/). This blog is meant to be more 'industry-facing', covering a range of topics from programming, data storage, ... to solving problems on-prem or using the Cloud.

The blog structure was forked from [Renan Franca's website](https://renanfranca.github.io/). Some references to Renan Franca's pages were intentionally left, and will be replaced soon.
